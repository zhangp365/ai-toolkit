          - '[trigger] , In the style of Scaramouche , This is a digital anime-style illustration featuring a young character with short, messy blue hair and purple eyes, wearing a black cap adorned with cat ears and a "Kitty" pin. The character is dressed in a white, oversized shirt with the word "Kitty" and other playful designs. They are holding a green and white lollipop, with a small, purple cat perched on their shoulder. The background is a soft lavender hue with various pastel geometric shapes and Japanese text. The overall aesthetic is cute and whimsical, with a focus on pastel colors and playful elements.'
